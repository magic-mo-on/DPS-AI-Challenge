Step 1: Kick off the training job
Click Create to enter the parameters for your training job and deployed model:

Under Dataset, select No managed dataset
Then select Custom training (advanced) as your training method and click Continue.
Enter mpg (or whatever you'd like to call your model) for Model name
Click Continue
In the Container settings step, select Custom container.

In the first box (Container image), click Browse and find the container you just pushed to Container Registry. 

Leave the rest of the fields blank and click Continue.

We won't use hyperparameter tuning, so leave the Enable hyperparameter tuning box unchecked and click Continue.

In Compute and pricing, leave the selected region as-is and select n1-standard-4 as your machine type.

Under the Prediction container step, select No prediction container.

#The training job will take around 15 minutes to complete. In the interest of time, we'll use a publicly accessible version of these trained model assets to deploy this model to an endpoint.
